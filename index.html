        <p> This project is about about OTP creation Using JS. One Time Password or OTP is one of the security mechanisms used in modern applications.Most of the web applications
            and even mobile applications are using one time passwords as the first step of verifying authenticity of a user
            because there are many issues with static passwords.Most of the users use the same password for different websites, hence if a person knows your password for any account then it is easy to crack open your different accounts.
            Keyloggers are able to capture your static passwords easily.</p>
